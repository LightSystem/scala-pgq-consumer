What's PGQ?
-----------

[PGQ](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PGQ_Tutorial) is the queueing solution from [Skytools](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Skytools), which was written by [Skype](http://www.skype.com/en/). It's a neat way of writing database triggers that send events to an event queue in [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/), which you can then poll with the PGQ API. An implementation of this polling is available in this library. 

A good presentation on PGQ is [available on SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/adorepump/skytools-pgq-queues-and-applications).

How do I use it?
